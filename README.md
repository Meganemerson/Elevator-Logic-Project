This project was completed for an online assessment to simulate the logic for an elevator. The elevator tracks its current floor and direction, processses and adds requests to queques, and determines the next floor based on direction priority. The elevator continues upward or downward when possible, and only reverses when there are no remaining requests in the direction the elevator is currently traveling. Requests at the current floor are given highest priority and evaluated immediately. Features such as timing, multiple elevators, and emergency stops are not implemented to maintain clarity.
